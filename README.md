Dear Reviewer

First of all: Thanks for taking your time to review my code.
I hope you had a fun during your course project and finally got the right answer.

You can start my code with

```
run_analysis.R
```

To make sure that on your computer R will find the data, please change the path in the R-code in the setwd() (which are the first lines after the first 3 remarks).

Good luck and take care, Tobias
