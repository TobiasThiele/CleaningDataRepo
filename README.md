Dear Reviewer

First of all: Thanks for taking your time to review my code.
I hope you had fun during your course project and finally got the right answer.

You can start my code with

```
run_analysis.R
```

Please make sure that the following files are in your working directory:
* y_test.txt
* X_test.txt
* subject_test.txt
* y_train.txt
* X_train.txt
* subject_train.txt
* activity_labels.txt
* features.txt

Information on where to get these files can be found in the Code Book

Good luck and take care, Tobias
